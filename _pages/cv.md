Research
======
* **Pomona College Physics Dept**, 2024
  * Analyzed cosmological simulations, used machine learning algorithms to identify and investigate stellar stream properties around low-mass galaxies in FIREbox.

* **Harvey Mudd College Physics Dept**, 2023
  * Modeled exoplanet migration driven by atmospheric loss, then verified our results against simulations in python.  Consulted experts and published a paper summarizing our findings. 

* **Portland State University Physics Dept**, 2022  
  * Used Googleâ€™s MediaPipe AI to develop accessible real-time skeleton tracking and center-of-mass calculation for physics pedagogy.
