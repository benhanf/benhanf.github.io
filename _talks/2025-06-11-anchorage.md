<a href = https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025AAS...24631401H/abstract> Abstract: </a> Stellar streams encode the history of galactic mergers and the properties of their progenitor systems, preserving information about the timing, mass, and orbital trajectories of past accretion events. Now is a particularly exciting time to study galactic substructure, as new observations from the Vera Rubin Observatory, Euclid, ARRAKIHS, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will reveal stellar streams in other galaxies. However, detecting stellar streams is challenging because they are extremely faint, low surface brightness features that are easily obscured by foreground stars, background galaxies, and observational noise, requiring deep, wide-field imaging and careful data processing to discover and characterize. To meet these challenges, I have developed code that integrates simulation data with machine learning methods to identify and analyze stellar streams around Milky Way analogs in the FIREbox cosmological volume simulation. Through this work, I provide tools for bridging theory to observation, and lay the groundwork for future efforts to constrain galaxy formation and dark matter models.
